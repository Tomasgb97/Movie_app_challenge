# MOVIE APP CHALLENGE

This is a small app that pretends to do a simple movie showcase and gives you a brief bio of every actor you can find in those movies. The data is fetched from "The movie database" API and then displayed on different cards, with a functional search bar.
The app was developed thinking of a mobile-first paradigm and is best suited for smartphone displays even though is responsive to 1920px width screens.

## Installation

To get the code of the project up and running on your PC simply clone the repo, install the needed dependencies via "npm install" and get yourself a free API key on The movie database website.
After that place that API KEY on your .env file under the name of "REACT__APP__NEWAPIKEY".
